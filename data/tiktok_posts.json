Now, the whole world is obsessed with Aoi’s form of self-expression. Last summer, she performed solo at the Tokyo Olympics closing ceremony. “I want to embody the things that I am attracted to: the wonderful traditional Japanese culture, art, buildings and people,” Aoi adds, “convey them to the present and pass them on to future generations.” Although her performances have gone from her kitchen to the global stage, they have not lost their sense of joy.

	"tiktok_text" : "“@selenagomez #programmatic My art is a tool that I use to better understand myself. It is a public display of my innermost thoughts, as well as my emotional highs and lows.” —Artist Esosa Odia ( @godesosa ) “After going through turbulent times in my life, I was feeling a lot of emotions that I was not able to put into words. That is when I turned to art, as a means to express myself,” says Esosa, who describes their multilayered digital art as “dreamy, playful, but also eerie and unsettling at times.” “COVID-19 impacted my work tremendously. Seeing everything in our world transform so rapidly, made me realize that nothing is inherently stable, anything can change. I feel as if that energy prompted me to embrace self-transformation as well.” Esosa’s art evolved to a singular monochromatic aesthetic. “I took a step back and meditated on who I am, and what I wanted to portray in my art. I felt a sense of guilt leaving behind my past-self, but now I have learned to celebrate this transformation. I have discovered that I am an ever-changing, malleable being. The same artist I was a year ago isn’t the same artist I am today, and I embrace that.” Photos by @godesosa 4d",

Lauded as one of his generation’s most trusted narrators, artist Cordae ( @cordae ) remains grounded and focused on making music about life's trials and triumphs with a powerful, poetic perspective. From his formative days and early remixes of popular songs, by way of the YBN collective, a crew of rappers, record producers and promoters, Cordae developed into 100% his own person. “I’m still far from perfect and have a lot of growing to do though,” says the two-time Grammy-nominated artist, who was raised in Maryland. “Writing music is a therapeutic thing for me. I try not to think of pressures set by others. I always set the goals and standards for myself. What’s most important to me when making music is making sure my fans can connect and relate. I always try to be as vulnerable and as transparent as possible when creating. Hopefully they can take away something from the music as well.” Photo of @cordae by @traviscolbert Edited&nbsp;·&nbsp; 6d",

I look at vessels and weapons from ancient China a lot. I like imagining what the craftsmen back then were thinking and feeling while making those items. I am hugely inspired by the warring states era of Chinese history for its boldness and vividness.” Jewel’s most recent work is an evolution of her distinctive MUA looks to three-dimensional masks. “I was inspired by Chinese traditional shadow play. It is an art form that uses cattle skin as paper. I wanted to create portable makeup looks and have the same mechanism as shadow play characters. Because I focus on bio-textile and natural materials, I created masks using bioplastic. I want to make Kam minority and Chinese culture sustainable and futuristic. I am also challenging social taboos — because I think behind the superficial and sugar-coated world humans created, the truth underneath is the only path to people’s hearts.” Photos by @a1jewel0310 1w",

Just ask 15-year-old 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee champ, (multiple) Guinness World Record holder and basketball star Zaila Avant-garde ( @zailaavantgarde ). “I really like to work hard at stuff. Whether it’s something that most people might consider work or something typically seen as an extracurricular pursuit — it’s pretty much all the same to me. I believe that every moment is a new opportunity to have fun and grow as a person, so I’m almost always motivated to try my best at things.” A voracious reader, Zaila read over a thousand chapter books before she participated and excelled in spelling bees. Now that she’s aged out of the spelling bee circuit, she’s training her focus on her first love: “the endless possibilities of basketball.” “I started playing basketball when I was 5, and my interest in juggling started when I was about 6. I figured that if I became proficient dribbling four balls and five balls, then I could easily handle one basketball,” says Zaila, who plays point guard. “When I first began spelling, I would sometimes think about how cool and inspiring it would be to all of the kids out there who could see themselves in me if I were to win Scripps; but as I continued deeper into my journey, that little idea expanded into one of the main motivating factors for me as I studied. My dream is to play college basketball and then go play in the WNBA. After that, I would like to work at NASA in my fields of interests: gene editing and neuroscience.” Reel by @zailaavantgarde Music by @itsruthb 1w",

One way astronomers can get a better sense of the foundations of our solar system is by observing ancient stellar relics like white dwarf stars, the immensely dense remnants of once-massive stars. @NASAHubble captured a collection of these galactic monuments 26,000 light-years from Earth. These primordial remains are from stars that formed quickly, at least on a cosmic timescale, in less than 2 billion years. Since we know the location of these white dwarf stars, we can tell how fast and far they move compared to the rest of our galaxy. Credit: NASA, ESA, A. Calamida and K.

Bumble, pictured in blue, is one of three identical robots that make up Team Astrobee, each differentiated by the colors on their shells. Designed and bulit by @NASAAmes , the Astrobees operate autonomously or via remote control by operators on the ground to perform tasks such as taking inventory or monitoring the environment aboard the station. Bumble was first launched to the station in 2019 with Honey (yellow Astrobee), and Queen (green) joined the crew later that year. Project CIMON, which was commissioned by the @GermanAeroSpaceCenter , is a voice-controlled robot is designed to act as a hands-free database, computer, and camera to support research. The teams behind Project CIMON also hope to study the platform’s potential to help reduce astronaut stress associated with isolation or group dynamics by providing social assistance.

The outer shell of this planetary nebula is formed from material ejected from a dying star. Despite the star decaying, it releases a beautiful display that looks surprisingly similar to the delicate petals of a camellia blossom. The “ring” in the center of the image is a thick cylinder of glowing gas and dust around the doomed star. As the star begins to run out of fuel, its core becomes smaller and hotter, boiling off its outer layers. Spitzer's infrared array camera detected this material expelled from the withering star. Previous images of the Ring Nebula taken by visible-light telescopes usually showed just the inner glowing loop of gas around the star. The outer regions resembling petals are especially prominent in this image because Spitzer saw infrared light from hydrogen molecules that absorbed ultraviolet radiation from the star, or were heated by powerful winds from the star. Located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra, this is one of the best examples of a planetary nebula, and a favorite target of amateur astronomers.

In its original form, though, it wouldn't look nearly as dazzling—raw images from Hubble and other space telescopes come in shades of gray, only showing the amount of light captured across all wavelengths the telescope's camera can measure. In order to turn those images into colorful sights like this one, we take photos with special filters that block out almost all wavelengths of light. One of the filters used on this image sees only light that would appear green to human eyes: light at wavelengths around 555 nanometers. The final multicolor image you see here uses data from seven different filters, collected with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys. Image credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, D.

This stellar tantrum – produced by an extremely young star in the earliest phase of formation – consists of an incandescent jet of gas traveling at supersonic speeds. The colorful wisps, found in the lower left of the image, are painted onto the sky by a young star swaddled in the partially illuminated cloud of obscuring dust seen to the upper right. Pictured punching through the enshrouding dust is an extremely hot, blue jet of gas released by the young star. As this jet speeds through space, it collides with cooler surrounding material. The result is the colorful object to the lower left, produced as the cooler material is heated by the jet. This wispy object resides near the Orion Nebular approximately 1,400 light-years away from Earth. Only a fraction of the entire jet extending between the infant star and the wispy object— called a Herbig-Haro object — is visible using the Hubble telescope. But with the introduction of @NASAWebb , which observes at predominantly infrared wavelengths, we will be able to peer into the dusty envelopes surrounding still-forming infant stars such as this, revolutionizing the study of jets from these young stars.

The “superbubble” in this nebula is about 250 light-years wide and scientists aren’t entirely sure why it formed the way it did. Stellar winds generated by massive stars in the interior of the “bubble” may have moved the ionized gas away from the center; another possibility is massive stars dying, resulting in huge explosions carving out the “bubble.” @NASAHubble captured this nebula located about 170,000 light-years away, and is classified is as an emission nebula, which is a nebula whose gas has been energized or ionized by radiation of nearby stars. As the gas begins to cool from a higher-energy state to a lower-energy state, it emits energy which in turn causes the nebula to glow. Credit: NASA, @EuropeanSpaceAgency , V. Ksoll and D.

From small, rocky Earth-sized worlds to gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, we've been looking for more than 30 years to find these exoplanets' subtle signals: the dimming of a distant star as a planet passes in front of it, or a small shift in the star's movement from its planet's gravity. With new telescopes like @NASAWebb and cutting-edge technology, we're discovering more worlds than ever—and even starting to capture direct images. We're learning that there are likely hundreds of billions of planets across the Milky Way! This video is a sonification of all 5,005 confirmed exoplanets, turning their discovery over time into music-like sound. As each exoplanet is discovered, a circle appears at its position in the sky. The size of the circle indicates the relative size of the planet's orbit and the color indicates which planet detection method was used to discover it: pink corresponds to radial velocity, purple to planetary transit, green to microlensing, red to timing variations, yellow to orbital brightness modulation, gray to astrometry, and blue to disk kinematics. The music is created by playing a note for each newly discovered world. The pitch of the note indicates the relative orbital period of the planet. Planets that take a longer time to orbit their stars are heard as lower notes, while planets that orbit more quickly are heard as higher notes. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/M. Russo, A.

NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion spacecraft atop has arrived at Launch Pad 39B at @NASAKennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for a final test before the @NASAArtemis I Moon mission. Stacked on the mobile launcher and mounted on the crawler-transporter, it took 10 hours and 28 minutes for SLS and Orion to travel four miles, or 6.4 kilometers, from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launchpad. The trip began at 5:47 p.m. EDT Thursday, March 17, and the 322-foot (98-meter) tall, 3.5-million-pound (1.6-million-kg) rocket and spacecraft arrived at the pad at 4:15 a.m. EDT on March 18. During the upcoming final test, known as the wet dress rehearsal, the Artemis I launch team will practice loading and unloading propellant into and from the rocket’s tanks and run through a full launch countdown. The uncrewed #Artemis I mission will lead the way for missions to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

Vande Hei’s stint aboard the ISS breaks the previous NASA record, held by retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, by 15 days. While clocking the single longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies from the hundreds executed during his mission. From growing vegetables in space, to measuring the effectiveness of enhanced spaceflight diets—the results of the studies Vande Hei participated in could help to pave the way for more people to travel to space on longer-duration missions as NASA pushes the boundaries of exploration to the Moon and Mars. After his return to the surface of Earth, Vande Hei will provide additional feedback to researchers investigating potential injuries such as bruises incurred by astronauts from the force of landing. This feedback will help scientists better understand whether long-term human spaceflight makes crew members more susceptible to such injuries. Through Vande Hei’s work, NASA will expand its knowledge about how the human body adapts to long-term spaceflight as we plan for future missions to the Moon and Mars. From all of us at NASA, thank you for your service, Mark, and congratulations! Credit: NASA 1w",

	"tiktok_text" : "The stars are aligning...so to speak. ⭐️ On March 11, the @NASAWebb Space Telescope team fully aligned the observatory’s mirrors with its primary imager, keeping its optics on track to meet or exceed science goals. “We now know we have built the right telescope,” said Ritva Keski-Kuha, deputy optical telescope element manager for Webb at @NASAGoddard . First science images are expected in about three months. So what do we see here? While the purpose of this image was to focus on the bright star at the center for alignment evaluation, Webb's optics and NIRCam imager are so sensitive that the galaxies and stars seen in the background show up. Each of the primary mirror segments have been adjusted to produce one unified image of the same star using only the NIRCam instrument. A red filter was used to enhance visual contrast. The next image shows a new “selfie,” created using a special lens inside of NIRCam. The lens is strictly for engineering purposes. Once fully operational, Webb will help solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

	"tiktok_text" : "It's a latte bigger than Earth. ☕️ This picture isn’t from your local coffee shop, it’s from our spacecraft Juno as it passed by Jupiter. Jupiter is well known for its Great Red Spot, but it’s also home to anticyclonic storms, known as white ovals. White oval’s can be storms the size of earth and can generate winds up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) and some storms can reach 60 miles (100 kilometers) tall. Jupiter is strapped with “belts” of white and red, that wrap around the planet. Traveling both east and west, why these belts are distinct is something mystery to scientists, one possibility is that the ammonia gas in the atmosphere travels up and down in alignment with the planets jet streams. Juno’s prime mission of measuring and studying Jupiter’s atmosphere and magnetic structure was completed in 2021, but it will continue to measure the planet’s unique structure until at least 2025.
